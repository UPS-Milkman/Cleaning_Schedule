# Cleaning_Schedule
This is a small piece of code that would prove to benefit human society for millions of years to come

Have you ever been tormented by a programmer flatmate who never seem to do any cleaning duty whatsoever, like, ever?
Have the smile on your face just froze the second you found out your new flatmate is a programmer?

But wait. There's something I need to tell you.

Programmers, are humans as well. They may be from a completly different realm where they mostly communicate with the outside world with 
things like feature files, but they are human nonetheless, they deserve to be understood and respected.

This project aims to help you break down the cultural barrier, and communicate your desired cleaning schedules to your programmer 
flatmate in their first language.

And before you get cold feet, worry not, you don't have to compile or run this project anywhere. Just copy-paste the code to your favourite
editor (or heck, just hit Ctrl + P) and print it out.

They all have a human interface that can consume this piece of code just fine, trust me.

Learn to effectively communicate, respect and try to understand different cultures, let's build this world a better tomorrow.







































Or a giant wall, I don't care.
